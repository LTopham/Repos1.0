# Repos1.0
Woooo first repos
There isn't anything interesting yet though, don't follow this
Am I branching things yet?

Apparently, I should've put licenses on everything.
MIT for 99% of what I wanted to do, GPL to force an open source style for the code, Apache if I wanted to patent something that I made
